Hi!  I’m Geeling, and I’m passionate about empowering our minds with technology. 

I am currently studying at [Caltech's Computation and Neural Systems](https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/academics/cns) with [ML Professor Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/) to develop new ML techniques that enable robust and useful neurotechnology.
