Hi!  I’m Geeling, and I’m passionate about empowering our minds with technology. 

I am currently at [Caltech's Computation and Neural Systems](https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/academics/cns) program studying with [Professor Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/) to develop new ML techniques that enable robust and useful neurotechnology. I started my academic journey with undergaduate research experiences at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), under the generous guidance of Professors [Vikash Gilja](https://neuro.eng.ucsd.edu/bio), [Bradley Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/), and [Virginia de Sa](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~desa/index.html).
